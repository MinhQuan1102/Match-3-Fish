# Match-3-Fish

PARTS THAT I'VE WORKED ON
- Remove unnecessary source code from Match-3 game, keep the core logic/function (game manager, game state, menu, panels, level condition)
- Change assets to fish icons
- Change the gameSettings scriptable object
- Add 3 buttons to main menu as 3 separate game modes (time attack, autoplay, autolose)
- Add winning panel
- Update the logic for instantiating items on the initial board so that every type of fish appears and the number of each is divisible by 3
- Add BottomCells to store cell (max 5 cells)
- Add the logic for user moving items to the bottom cells by tapping on them
- Add the logic for clearing 3 identical items in the botton cells
- Add animation when moving items to bottom cells and backwards, and when 3 identical items in the bottom cell are cleared
- Update the winning/losing condition
- Add auto-win / auto-lose game mode
- Add Time-attack mode in which player can return a cell from bottom cell to its initial position by tapping on their initial position

PARTS THAT I'VE FAILED TO ACHIEVE
- Cannot return an item from bottom cell to its initial position by tapping it in the bottom cell

Time taken to do the task: ~ 8 hours.
